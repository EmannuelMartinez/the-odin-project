    // I think an important part about writing code, is also
    // understanding what you just wrote lol

    // Plus, this was a lesson on how...DOM manipulation is
    // important, but, also, how just reading what a thing
    // actually is can help a lot.

    // Like sure, I could have looked up the million and
    // one methods attached to objects on some site...

    // Or, I could have just seen the parameters of what the
    // problem was asking of me, saw something new, and thought

    // "Huh, I should put that into the console and see
    // what attributes are attached to it...maybe that'll give
    // me a good jumping off point."

    // I can read all about how a drill works, but until I use
    // the damn thing, then what am I really learning lol


    // So here, we're given a fundamental DOM object to
    // work with, `document`. Here, putting it into
    // our console, we see that the document.body will print out every
    // child that exists within the body tag!

    // Nifty, good to know that DOM objects are literally just that,
    // objects.

    // They also contain certain useful attributes, such as

    // childNodes, which are all the children attached to
    // a specific DOM node

    // nodeType, whose value is `1` whenever we're talking about
    // html tags as we know them, e.g., <h1>, <p>, <random-tag>

    // node.ELEMENT_NODE, whose value is also `1`, and is used to assign
    // those aforementioned html tags this number. *hint hint*

    // node.nodeName, which is the UPPERCASE name of the current node.

    // and honestly, outside a bit of recursion, we've solved
    // the problem.

    function byTagName(node, tag) {
      let nodeChildren = [];
      tag = tag.toUpperCase();

      function exploreNodeChildren(node) {
        for (let i = 0; i < node.childNodes.length; i++) {
          let child = node.childNodes[i];
          if (child.nodeType === node.ELEMENT_NODE) {
            if (child.nodeName === tag) {
              nodeChildren.push(child);
            }
            exploreNodeChildren(child);
          }
        }
      }

      exploreNodeChildren(node);
      return nodeChildren;
    }

    console.log(byTagName(document.body, "span"));
